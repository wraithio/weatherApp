### Peer Review by: Alexander Soria
comments: Your webpage works well! You have your data populated for all sites, and I like how you have a default city to demonstrate how the page works. You also have the icons placed there too to signify the forecast for each of the 5 days. 

Here are some issues I found present in your work:

1. When adding to your favorites bar, after 3 or 4 added favorites, it will push the 5 day forecast down more and more. You may need to have an overflow-y: scroll style or something simiilar to prevent this. 

2. Your cards appear to be uneven. Check the cards section of bootstrap; they have tips on how to make all your cards appear evenly aligned.

Aside from those two issues, your page works as intended! Nicely done!
